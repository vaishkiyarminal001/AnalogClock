<h3>This is a simple web page that displays an analog clock with both analog and digital representations.</h3>

<h2>Description</h2>

The analog clock is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock's hands (hour, minute, and second) rotate based on the current time obtained from the JavaScript `Date` object. The digital time is also displayed below the analog clock, and it updates in real-time.

## Usage

To view the analog clock, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser.
3. The analog clock will be displayed on the page, and the digital time will be shown below it.

## Files

The following files are included in this project:

- `index.html`: The HTML file that contains the structure and content of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles and layout of the analog clock.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the rotation of the clock's hands and updates the digital time.<br><br><br>
